# Apple2Sharp - dotnet C# Apple ][+ emulator

*For Windows only

This is an Apple II+ emulator with the 6502 processor. Made for pure fun, several challenges and concepts learned with this project. Based on the project https://github.com/AndiPexton/6502, which features an Apple I emulator. I updated the project and fixed some errors in some Opcodes.

This emulator brings some features such as:

- Color/Monochrome Video (Hires)
- Sound emulated as Speaker (using NAudio component https://github.com/naudio/NAudio)
- Clock Accelerator (Up to approximately 50Mhz, depending on the Hardware used)
- Language card (16kb expansion)
- Saturn 128kb RAM card
- 80 Columns Card
- Disk II Card DOS/Prodos compatible .dsk, .po, .do image files*
- Joystick (when activated, use arrows for directions and control/shift for buttons 1/2)


*.dsk files examples at \disks folder

Some points of necessary improvements, such as: greater sound stability and reduction of machine consumption due to clock control. (C# has some Thread.Sleep limitations, minimum of 1ms, with little precision).

Suggestions are welcome and I appreciate any kind of contribution to the project.
